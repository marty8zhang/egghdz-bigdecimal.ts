# About

A TypeScript `BigDecimalInterface` tries to help with overcoming the accuracy issue of JavaScript
floating number calculation, inspired by [MikeMcl/big.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/big.js/)
and
Java's [`BigDecimal`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/docs/api/java.base/java/math/BigDecimal.html)
.

It currently also includes a `BigJsAdapter` for `big.js`.

# How to use it?

There is no documentation, because I believe a well-written interface should require minimum or no
documentation. Just check
out [`BigDecimalInterface.ts`](https://github.com/marty8zhang/egghdz-bigdecimal.ts/blob/master/src/BigDecimalInterface.ts)
and you should know how to use the adapter immediately. :)
