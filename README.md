# About

A TypeScript `BigDecimalInterface` tries to help with overcoming the accuracy issue of JavaScript
floating number calculation, inspired by [MikeMcl/big.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/big.js/)
and
Java [`BigDecimal`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/docs/api/java.base/java/math/BigDecimal.html)
.

It currently also includes a `BigJsAdapter` for `big.js`.
